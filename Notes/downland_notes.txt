Fun Notes
	
	Room Timers
	there is a timer for each room
	leave a room and its timer will increase by the amount decreased in the current room
	all room timers are updated every frame	
	
	The bouncing ball is hard coded to spawn at the same spot, no matter
	which level.
	
	there's an offscreen buffer with a clean version of the level 
	it's used for terrain collisions for the player?
	it's used to clean the screen when preparing the next frame?
	
	A running memory counter seems part of the memory protection. 
	In this version just seems to read every byte location.

Questions

	are the drop wobble times constant or random?
	how is drop wobble handled?

	how does the player code flow?
	what is the mysterious sprite data?	
	what decides how close a drop is to the rope?
	how are floor collisions detected?
	how is detecting vertical ropes done?
	how is detecting horizontal ropes done?

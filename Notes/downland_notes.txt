Fun Facts
	
	Room Timers
	there is a timer for each room
	leave a room and its timer will increase by the amount decreased in the current room
	all room timers are updated every frame	
	
	The bouncing ball is hard coded to spawn at the same spot, no matter
	which level.
	
	there's an offscreen buffer with a clean version of the level 
	it's used for terrain collisions for the player?
	it's used to clean the screen when preparing the next frame?
	
	A running memory counter seems part of the memory protection. 
	In this version just seems to read every byte location.

Sprite Data Fun Facts

	some animations are copied to ram, creating four copies
	drops already have their four copies stored in rom	
	splat and doors are copied to a dedicated work buffer on demand when needed to be drawn

	
Room Pickups Fun Facts

	There are exactly five pick ups per room
	The first two are always keys, the last three are treasures
	treasures are randomly chosen

How To	

	How to change the game timer on start?
		change memory location cbac to 0xFFFF
		
	how to change the game timer at runtime?
		player 1 timers are located at 3e89
	
	How to limit the number of drops to 1?	
	
		For title screen, change d124 value from A (10) to 1. 
		For game rooms, change the values d12a and d12e to 0.

		
		
		
		
Ball

	when hitting the ground a counter at 0x32 is set with a negative value
		every frame the value goes up until it goes positive, then decrements
		until 0 at which point it starts falling again
		
	Fun Facts
	
		There's a table in the code that specifies which room has the bouncing ball. 
		The table has entries past room 10 (index 9), which might suggest there were 
		more rooms at one point. The extra rooms specified in the table are 
		10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

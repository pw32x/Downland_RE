Each drop data is 13 bytes long.
byte : description
0: state / ceiling wiggle countdown 
    values:
    0: disabled
    1: initialized but not running
       will be initialized next update
    0xA8 - 0x80: wiggling
    0x7F: falling
1-2: drop speed (0x200 falling, 
		 toggles between 0x80 and
		 0xff80 when jiggling to
		 move up and down)
3-4: y position (pixel + subpixel)
5: x position (0 - 127)
6-7: location of sprite in ram
8-9: draw location in video page
10-11 (a-b): previous frame draw location in video page
12 (c): the collision mask of the bottom of the drop.
        the mask is different depending on which frame
        of the drop sprite it uses.

Fun Facts:

- when the player has completed the game once, all 10 drops are active.

- when the player hasn't completed the game at least once, the number of
drops is the room mumber + 1. Unless the room number is five or less,
where the number of drops is 6.

So, in other words
room 0 to 5: 6 drops
room 6 to 9: room number + 1 drops
completed game at least once: always 10 drops

- Drops wiggle for 40 frames. Wiggle time is constant. 

- When the player has completed the game less than 3 times, it adjusts horizontal positions of drops to be even. Otherwise X positions are unaffected, which (I think) means that drops are closer to the sides of vines.
